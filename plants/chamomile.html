                    <h2>Habitat and Growing Conditions</h2>

                    <h3>Growing Conditions</h3>
                    <p><strong>Perennial:</strong> This type is a long-lived plant that will come back each year from
                        its root system.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Full sun to partial shade. Full sun is ideal for blooming.</p>
                    <p><strong>Soil:</strong> Prefers well-drained, loamy, or sandy soil with a neutral pH. It does not
                        need rich soil, and too much fertilizer can decrease flower quality.</p>
                    <p><strong>Water:</strong> Keep the soil moist but not soggy, especially when seedlings are young.
                        Established plants are drought-tolerant and only need watering during prolonged dry periods.</p>

                    <h3>Planting and Harvesting</h3>
                    <p><strong>Planting:</strong> Sow seeds directly in the garden in May, or start them indoors 6-8
                        weeks before the last frost and plant out in June.</p>
                    <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> It's best to propagate new plants by dividing established clumps in
                        the spring or fall, rather than sowing seeds.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sowing:</strong> Since seeds need light to germinate, surface sow them and press them
                        lightly into the soil without covering them.</p>
                    <p><strong>Transplanting:</strong> Handle seedlings gently, as they do not transplant well once they
                        get larger. Consider planting the entire small container the seedling is in if possible.</p>
                    <p><strong>Harvesting:</strong> Harvest the flowers in July and August.</p>
                    <ul class="indented-list">
                        <li><strong>When:</strong> Pick on a dry morning, just after the dew has dried, to capture the
                            peak essential oils.</li>
                        <li><strong>How:</strong> Cut the flower heads when they are fully open. You can also snip
                            branches with open flowers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Drying:</strong> Hang bunches of branches to dry in a cool, well-ventilated area.
                            Once dry, you can strip the blossoms from the stems and store them in an airtight container.

                    <h3>Family</h3>
                    <p>Asteraceae (Daisy family)</p>
                    <h3>Parts Used</h3>
                    <p>The flowers</p>
                    <h3>Forms Used and Doses</h3>
                    <p><strong>Infusion:</strong> 5 to 10 flower heads per cup (Valnet). Ideally taken before meals, as
                        it is a bitter plant that will prepare the digestion. If the infusion is too bitter for some
                        people, then take tincture instead.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tincture:</strong> Use 500 ml of 45° alcohol for 100 g of dried flowers. Note: You will
                        likely need to place a clean stone on the flowers to weigh them down so the alcohol covers them
                        well in the jar.

                        <strong>Dosage:</strong> 40 to 60 drops per dose, in a little water. Multiple doses per
                        day can be taken if necessary.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Herbal Oil:</strong> Can be used externally for all types of skin issues.</p>
