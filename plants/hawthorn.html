                    <h2>Habitat and Growing Conditions</h2>

                    <h3>Habitat</h3>
                    <p><strong>Geographic:</strong> Native to southern Scandinavia, the Baltic region, and other parts
                        of Europe.</p>
                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Found in woodlands, hedges, thickets, and disturbed or semi-cleared
                        areas.</p>
                    <p><strong>Elevation:</strong> Can grow from sea level up to 1,800 m altitude.</p>
                    <p><strong>Soil:</strong> Grows on a variety of soils, including limestone, granite, or volcanic
                        rock, and is adaptable to chalk, clay, loam, and sand. Avoid areas with constantly waterlogged
                        soil.</p>

                    <h3>Growing Conditions</h3>
                    <p><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Prefers full sun to partial shade. It can grow in shade but may have
                        poor growth and pale leaves in very low light.</p>
                    <p><strong>Soil pH:</strong> Tolerates a range of soil pH levels, including acid, alkaline, or
                        neutral.</p>
                    <p><strong>Water:</strong> Has average water needs. It is drought-tolerant once established but
                        needs regular watering during its first year to develop a strong root system.</p>
                    <p><strong>Hardiness:</strong> Very hardy, tolerating cold temperatures. Can withstand exposed
                        conditions and urban pollution.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pruning:</strong> Requires minimal pruning, typically just for removing dead, diseased,
                        or misplaced branches. Pruning is best done in late winter.</p>

                    <h3>Harvesting</h3>
                    <p><strong>Leaves:</strong> Although leaves can be harvested in spring, summer, and autumn, they are much more beautiful and tender in spring when they are just emerging.</p>

                    <p><strong>Flowers:</strong> Harvest flowers when barely open or still in bud, otherwise the petals will fall off during drying. Dry them away from sunlight in a dry place. Store in airtight jars to preserve them as long as possible away from moisture.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fruits:</strong> Harvest the fruits in autumn when they are still a beautiful red color. They will keep their nice red color which will darken slightly, and will wrinkle slightly while hardening.</p>

                    <h2>Active Constituents</h2>
                    <p><strong>Flavonoids:</strong> These are a major group of beneficial compounds found in hawthorn
                        leaves, flowers, and fruits (include hyperoside, rutin, isoquercetin, and vitexin).</p>

                    <p><strong>Proanthocyanidins:</strong> Also known as OPCs, these are a type of flavonoid that are
                        particularly important for cardiovascular health. They are composed of smaller units like
                        catechin and epicatechin.</p>

                    <p><strong>Organic Acids:</strong> Hawthorn is rich in various organic acids (include malic, citric,
                        and ascorbic acid).</p>

                    <p><strong>Triterpenes:</strong> Ursolic and oleanolic acid, found in hawthorn flowers and leaves.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Pectin:</strong> Hawthorn fruit is a source of pectin, a type of soluble fiber.</p>
